<h3>Global Immersion Experience</h3>


<p>
Global Enterprise Technology Immersion Experience is a program that gives interns the opportunity to implement an enterprise improvement. In Ohio State’s chapter of GET-IE, two students and I observed an oportunity for an application similar to “Stack-Overflow” and “Amazon Turk” for large companies.
<br>
<br>
SUMMER 2016
<br>

While I worked at Harris in Rochester, NY, Drew R. worked at Hyland On Base in Cleveland, OH and Bernie S. worked at J.P. Morgan Chase in Columbus, OH. During the summer, we read about several business topics including the Agile Manifesto, Porter’s Five Forces, the Business Process Model Notation and the Business Score Card. We observed our companies’ processes. We interviewed co-workers about improvements that could be made.

 <br><br>

GET RETREAT SEPTEMBER 2016

 <br>

In Columbus, a one-day meeting was held to present our internship experiences. In a business sense, we found that our companies were very different. Some thrived on order where others thrived on chaos. Some of our companies’ customers depended on the services for life versus death, where other companies’ customers needed the services for improvements that saved time and money.

 <br>

We shared ideas that would positively affect one or more of our companies. To select the top idea, we used a selection matrix that took cost-saving potential, sources of customer complaints, opportunity for improvement, ease in change and source of staff frustration into account.

 <br><br>

DRAFTING THE PLAN FALL 2016 

<br>
While continuing to work either full time or part-time remotely, we met weekly via web chat to continue our project. We worked to analyze functional and non functional objectives, state concise problems and goals, and develop a backlog for user stories.

<br>
We decided that the application would be called “InSourced,” and it would cut costs by decreasing the amount of time that employees spent figuring out a problem that another employee could help solve quickly. Simple questions could be asked and answered, and stored in a database for others to reference. The application would also have an option for employees to explore tasks in other segments of the company if they were not currently busy with a local task. It would improve imbalances in work loads between different project groups in a company. It would give opportunity for medium and non-critical ideas to be explored and implemented.
<br>

We drafted a 25-page business development plan. It was decided that the project would be passed to a Capstone group for Spring 2017.


<br><br>

PRESENTING THE IDEA - DECEMBER 2016

<br>
My two group members, instructor, and I met to present the project to two Harris Employees. Since the Harris Employees were in Rochester, NY, we met via Skype. We presented a summary of our business development plan. The project was set to be finished by May 2017.
