<h1 class="w3-center">Hello World</h1>


<p class="container">I came from a small town where high school computer sciences classes did not exist. I was good at math, so I declared Computer and Information Science as my major at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. After one year of programming experience, I taught beginning Java courses to children at iD Tech in Cleveland, Ohio. After two years of college I began a software engineering internship at Harris Communication Systems in Rochester, New York, where I worked with embedded software and continuous integration on the Multi-Channel Manpack Radio. I graduate May 2018 and I'm currently fascinated with web development.</p>
